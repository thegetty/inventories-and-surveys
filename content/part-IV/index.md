Part IV of this book expands on the heritage inventory and survey work described in [part III](/part-iii/) to present two case studies that are practical applications by public agencies in the United Kingdom and Southeast Asia. [Chapter 13](/part-iv/chapter-13/) describes how the City of Lincoln, England, applied its historic environment record (HER) for archaeological management. [Chapter 14](/part-iv/chapter-14/) details how the Singapore National Heritage Board conducted a nationwide survey and used the resulting data to create a broadly accessible inventory of intangible cultural heritage.

      <td>It appears that there is a limit to the number of contributors that can be added to one district. At approximately 700 entries, the Leimert Park district ceased to allow new contributors to be added, instead providing an error that says 'Unable to load photos for the resource.'</td>

With this error, the surveyors were unable to move forward, or to close the "View Resources" screen. This problem appears to have been related to the character limit in the "General Comments" field noted above, as the issue was resolved once the General Comments text was edited.</td>

It would be useful to be able to evaluate individual properties under this context as well. Perhaps a “Residence” property type should be added to each of the suburbanization themes.</td>

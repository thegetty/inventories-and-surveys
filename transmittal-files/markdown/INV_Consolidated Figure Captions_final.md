**caption:** The inventory lifecycle. A heritage inventory is an ongoing record (bottom) that is created and (ideally) updated and improved over time through a range of information collection and assessment activities (top), including surveys. Note: The types of activity shown are merely examples. Aside from the initial inventory creation activity, the other activity types may occur in any sequence.

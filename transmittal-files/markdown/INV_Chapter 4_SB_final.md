## Arches in Use

Arches is currently being used independently by heritage organizations worldwide to serve their individual heritage inventory and survey goals. Because the software is powerful and flexible it can be customized to manage heritage inventory data on a national, regional, and site-specific scale and to fit the implementor’s methodology and practice. Given that Arches is open-source software that can be downloaded and installed anonymously, it is not possible to know of everyone who is using it and how. As of this writing, the GCI knows of nearly one hundred implementations of Arches (already launched or in preparation), with many more in the planning stage. The known implementations collectively record heritage spanning five continents and nearly sixty countries. See “Who is using Arches?” at [https://www.archesproject.org/ implementations-of-arches/](https://www.archesproject.org/%20implementations-of-arches/) for further information on deployments of Arches.

To highlight a few examples, Arches has been implemented to manage the following national heritage inventories and survey initiatives:

-   **Barbados National Registry of Historic Places.** The Barbados Ministry of Creative Economies, Culture and Sports, with support from the Organization of American States, deployed Arches as the official repository of the Barbados National Registry of Historic Places. See <https://heritagebarbados.gov.bb/>.

-   **Canadian Register of Historic Places.** Parks Canada is deploying Arches to manage and publish online federal data of the Canadian Register of Historic Places and the Directory of Federal Heritage Designations.

Additionally, several public agencies have implemented Arches to manage their heritage inventories for cities or urban areas, including:

-   **Lincoln Historic Environment Record.** As discussed in **chapter 13**, the City of Lincoln, U.K., has deployed Arches as its HER, branded Arcade, to manage the city’s archaeological and architectural heritage. See [[https://arcade.lincoln.gov.uk/]{.underline}](https://arcade.lincoln.gov.uk/).

-   **PHL PlatForm.** The City of Philadelphia has implemented Arches to inventory, map, showcase, and help preserve its historic built environment. See <https://phlhistory.phila.gov/>.

Arches is also being used to manage site-level heritage inventories. The Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) is a U.S. federal agency that manages a 272-acre historic campus in Washington, D.C., that was established in 1851 for military veterans. The agency has deployed Arches as the AFRH Information and Resource Inventory System (AFRH-IRIS). Staff use IRIS to carry out campus planning and federal environmental compliance activities, and it is available for public research as well.
